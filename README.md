### It's a simple project for my university that finds the fastest way from point A to point Z using backtracking and fallowing simple rules like: 



->You can only move top,down,right,left in a 2D array.

->You can only stop on positions with at last a symbol of the preview symbols (YY -> GY) OR (HY -> GH).

->You start at position 0x0 [Top left].

->Your goal is to come in the last position 4x4 [bottom right].
